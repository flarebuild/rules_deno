# rules_deno example: 500routes

Defines a server app with many routes & controllers, with 500 being the default.

Additionally, many contrived "services" are generated, each with a dependency on the previous N, so that each service has a growing number of dependencis. These "services" are dependencies of the corresponding controllers, allowing the simulation of complex dependency graph and allowing a clear demonstration of the TSC bottleneck when it comes typechecking and compiling code at this scale.

## Running

- Build with `deno bundle index.ts`
- Run with `deno run --allow-env --allow-net index.ts`

## Code Generation

This code is generated by `gen.py`, and more routes/controllers/services can be generated by editing this script. Generated code is not checked into git, so be sure to invoke this once before attempting to build or run the project.

## Characteristics

With 500 generated controllers/services, this example project has the following characteristics:

- 1002 TypeScript files
- 402,780 lines of TypeScript
- `deno bundle` takes ~75 seconds
- `deno run` takes ~40 seconds--need to dive deeper into the caching mechanism here
